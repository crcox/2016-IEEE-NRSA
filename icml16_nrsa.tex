	\section{Conclusion}
%We have developed and demonstrated a new approach for whole-brain Representational Similarity Analysis called Network RSA (NRSA). Unlike traditional RSA methods that consider only specific regions of interest or spherical clusters of the cortex,  NRSA can discover arbitrarily structured brain networks (possibly widely distributed and non-local) that encode similarity information.  NRSA is posed as a sparsity-regularized multi-task regression problem. This allows us to effectively search over all subsets of voxels (not just localized clusters) to detect similarity-encoding networks.  We proposed a new sparsity regularizer for multi-task regression that is able to cope with strongly correlated covariates (voxels in the fMRI application), which can perform better than the conventional group lasso. named the GrOWL.  Experiments with real and synthetic datasets demonstrated the potential of our new approach.

We have developed and demonstrated a new approach for whole-brain Representational
Similarity Analysis called Network RSA (NRSA). Unlike traditional RSA methods that
consider only specific regions of interest or spherical clusters of the cortex,  NRSA can
discover arbitrarily structured brain networks (possibly widely distributed and non-local)
that encode similarity information.  NRSA is posed as a sparsity-regularized multi-task
regression problem. This allows us to effectively search over all subsets of voxels (not
just localized clusters) to detect similarity-encoding networks.  We further proposed a
new sparsity regularizer for multi-task regression, the GrOWL, that is able to cope with
strongly correlated covariates, a serious challenge for sparsity-based approaches to fMRI
analysis.

Our analysis of synthetic data generated from a neural network model of word-reading
showed that the GrOWL identifies signal-carrying features more consistently than group
lasso when signal is redundant; that the approach can discover different feature subsets
encoding different kinds of similarity structure; and that the weight matrix $\bW$ can be
used to uncover subnetworks of features that jointly work to encode such structure.
Analysis of visual similarity structure in fMRI data from a picture-viewing task further
established that the approach can be used to find cortical regions and subnetworks that
likewise express a target similarity structure. In future work these methods may be useful
for discovering such structure for cases where the interesting cortical regions and
networks have proven elusive.
