\emph{Representational Similarity Analysis} (RSA) is a tool for testing whether localized brain regions encode representational similarities between stimuli.  In this paper we propose a new approach called {\em Network RSA} that can discover arbitrarily structured brain networks (possibly widely distributed and non-local) that encode similarity information.  We show that Network RSA can be posed as a sparsity-regularized multi-task regression problem. Standard methods, such as the group lasso, may not select important voxels if they happen to be strongly correlated with others. To address this shortcoming we present a new regularizer for multitask regression called \emph{Group Ordered Weighted $\ell_1$} (GrOWL). We show, in theory and in fMRI experiments, how GrOWL deals with strongly correlated covariates.
