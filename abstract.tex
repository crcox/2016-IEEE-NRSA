\emph{Representational Similarity Analysis} (RSA) is a tool for discovering brain regions that encode representational similarities among stimuli. Existing RSA methods consider only localized networks, such as specific regions of interest or spherical volumes within cortex.  In this paper we propose a new approach for {\em whole-brain} RSA that can discover arbitrarily structured brain networks (possibly widely distributed and non-local) that encode similarity information.  We pose the RSA problem as a sparsity-regularized multi-task regression problem. This allows us to effectively search over all subsets of voxels (not just localized clusters) to detect similarity-encoding networks.  A baseline approach for this regression task is the group lasso, but this approach may not select important voxels if they happen to be strongly correlated with other voxels.  To address this shortcoming we present a new regularizer for multitask regression with strongly correlated covariates (voxels in fMRI applications) named \emph{Group Ordered Weighted $\ell_1$} (GrOWL).  Theoretically, we show that GrOWL automatically clusters and averages regression coefficients associated with strongly correlated variables. We apply the group lasso and GrOWL approach to whole-brain RSA, demonstrating and comparing our new approach in simulations and real-data experiments.
